# Bi-LSTM-and-Bi-GRU
This project is an implementation of Bi-LSTM and Bi-GRU algorithms in C, which I did it during my research internship at IPM (Institute for Research in Fundamental Sciences).
The codes have comments and besides the C implementation, there is a python implementation for each of the algorithms, and at the end of python and C implementation for each algorithm, there is a test that indicates the correctness of the C implementation. You can run easily both python and C codes for both algorithms and see the same results.
params_utils folder contains the parameters and functions that are used in both algorithms and gru and lstm folders contain C and python implementation for each algorithm.
Hope you enjoy this project :)
